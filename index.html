                    In today's fine edition of <em>The Danish Mail</em>, we present to you the most shocking and flabbergasting piece of information from the Royal Family:
                     Prince Hamlet of the Kingdom of Denmark, according to reports by insiders, has seemingly gone 'mad'. 
                     This recent development follows the death of the late King Hamlet, as well as the coronation of King Claudius. Seeing such, Hamlet's behavior
                     (according to our treasured insiders) has been relatively concerning, especially in regard to how he behaves around important members within the Royal Court.              </p>
                        Lord Hamlet's bizarre behaviour has been observed by many, including his own mother, Queen Gertrude, and his uncle, King Claudius. 
                        This is especially true during his supposed conversation with Lord Polonius, where Hamlet declares, <em>"You are a fishmonger."</em>, 
                        thereby referring to Lord Polonius as a fishmonger, which is a term used to describe someone who sells fish. This abstract use of diction is further exemplified by Lord Hamlet, when he later indirectly insults Polonius by stating, <em>"If the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion- have you a daughter?"</em>
                        This observation has led many to believe that Hamlet's mind reflects the abhorrent state of Denmark, as well as the corruption that has seeped into the Royal Court, possibly hinting at unbridled betrayal and treachery in our coming days.

            <h3 id="section-title">Why Lord Hamlet's Apparent Madness May Not Be What It Seems Like</h3>
            <p id="section-text">Howver, despite Lord Hamlet's apparent madness, there are several contrasting factors that hint at him <em>possibly</em> feigning his madness. 
                Lord Hamlet's apparent wordplay infront of his friends, Sir Rosencrantz and Sir Guildenstern, in the line, <em>"I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw."</em> 
                indicates the layered meaning sandwiched beneath his manner-of-language, as well as the sarcasm by which he indirectly admits to his friends that his "feigned" madness, may just be, well, "feigned". 
                This revelation speaks to us the volumes at which the dark seeds of treachery and mystery that traverse through the courts of the Royal Family, as it helps highlight a figment of Lord Hamlet's more cold, calculating side.  </p>
                <p id="section-text">Furthermore, the fact that Lord Hamlet is able to maintain his composure and wit in front of his friends, as well as the fact that he is able to manipulate those around him, suggests that he may not be as mad as he appears to be. 
                    This is further supported by the fact that he is able to maintain his relationships with those around him, such as his love interest, Ophelia, and his friends, Sir Rosencrantz and Sir Guildenstern. 
                    This suggests that Lord Hamlet may be using his apparent madness as a way to manipulate those around him, and to achieve his own goals. His unforeseen cruelty is put on display when he trashes Princess Ophelia in a crude manner while also referring to her as a prostitute. 
                    This paints a seering, egregious picture of our Lord, revealing that underneath his charm and charisma, there lies a villainous and devilish beast that is tearing at the seams of our beloved kingdom. This "dark" side of Lord Hamlet serves as a clear warning to others: 
                you must not cross his path, lest you face his untempered wrath.  </p>

            <h3 id="conclusion-h3"><span id="conclusion-h3-wrapper">What This Could Mean For Us</span></h3>
            <p id="conclusion-text">Indeed, Lord Hamlet's imminent "madness", paired with the death of his late father, Sir King Hamlet, resonantes a deeper, darker meaning within our beloved Kingdom of Denmark. 
                If we do not take heed of this forewarning that has been installed before us by the heavens, we are setting ourselves up for failure, for, if there is <em>anything</em> that the current state of the Royal Family declares to us, it is that greed, power, and self-interest are the seed to all evil and self-corruption.   </p>
